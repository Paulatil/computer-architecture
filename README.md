source files for the class design project
the "reports" directory contains three different reports detailing the project progress: from ISA design to datapath design and full simulation of RTL models.
the ".src" directory contains the source files and test-benches  written in verilog 
the "BRAM" directory contains the memory IP wrapper generated with the vivado design tool. The design adopts the block RAM distribution for the purpose of locality.
